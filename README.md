# IT-Practice-year_2-_qr
Entails prototype as described in the Project Initiation Document(PID)

## The prototype will contain a webpage with keywords of different colors and sizes. This webpage is called index.html and is the main page of the prototype. Each word is clickable and upon clicking the word, a popup with a qr code is presented. The FAQ's corresponding to that keyword can be acessed by scanning this qr code on a mobile phone.

All the files in the directory are described below :

 1. The folder **fq** contains all the qr code that will popup when any of the keyword is selected.
 2. The folder **images** contains all the images used on the index page(main page).
 3. **index.html** is the file that contains the content to de displayed on the main page. The page makes use of all the other files in the directory.
 4. **style.css** contains the style used to style different parts of the html pages.
 5. **tagcloud.json** contains the json files used by the prototype to link the keywords to different attributes. For example, color of the keyword, link to the relevant FAQ, size, etc.
 6. **wordcloud2.js** contains the javascript library used by the prototype to generate the wordcloud. It was designed by *timdream.org* and can be acessed using this link(*https://wordcloud2-js.timdream.org/#love*)
 
 
 The team would like to thank the project supervisor for helping us to deliver this prototype and make use of the library. Also we are very grateful to timdream.org for designing this powerful javascript library.
